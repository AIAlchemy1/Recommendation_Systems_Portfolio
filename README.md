## Introduction

This portfolio represents my journey and achievements in the field of Recommendation Systems, showcasing my ability to design, implement, and optimize systems that improve user experience through personalized suggestions. My projects cover a range of techniques from basic popularity-based algorithms to complex collaborative filtering and matrix factorization methods.

## Projects

### Popularity Based Recommendations

Developed recommendation systems that suggest items based on their popularity, demonstrating the power of simple yet effective recommendation strategies.

### Content Based Recommendations

Implemented algorithms that analyze item features to recommend similar items, enhancing user engagement by aligning suggestions with their preferences.

### Matrix Factorization using SVD

Explored the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization, enabling the discovery of latent features for more accurate recommendations.

### Collaborative Filtering

Designed systems using both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging user interactions to generate personalized recommendations.

### Market Based Analysis

Applied market basket analysis to understand the relationships between products, facilitating the recommendation of complementary items.

## Case Studies

### Joke Recommender System
Built a system that recommends jokes to users based on their humor preferences, combining user ratings and content analysis.

### Song Recommender
Developed a personalized song recommender using collaborative filtering, enhancing user experience by matching music to individual tastes.

### Top N Books
Created a dynamic system recommending the top N books based on user preferences and trends, utilizing a mix of content-based and popularity-based techniques.

### Top N Restaurants
Implemented a recommendation engine for restaurants, taking into account user reviews and preferences to suggest top dining options.

### Top K Electronics
Designed a system to recommend the top K electronics products, using collaborative filtering to tailor suggestions according to user behavior and preferences.
